## Overview
The goal of this project is to create a predictive model that estimates house prices based on the size of the house in square feet. The model is trained on a dataset containing various features related to house prices.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is located in the `dataset/` directory and is named `house_price_prediction_dataset.csv`. It contains the following columns:
- **House Size (sq ft)**: The size of the house in square feet.
- **House Price (INR Lakhs)**: The price of the house in lakhs of Indian Rupees.

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the required libraries using pip:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn


## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   git clone https://github.com/Vishnugnath/Simple-Linear-Regression-House-price-prediction.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:

   cd Simple-Linear-Regression-House-price-prediction


3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   jupyter notebook "Prediction of house prices based on house size in Metro cities.ipynb"
   

4. Run the notebook to see the predictions and visualizations.

## Results
The results include:
- A comparison of actual vs. predicted house prices.
- Visualizations showing the relationship between house size and price, both for the training and testing datasets.
- Predictions for house prices based on a range of sizes.

### Example Output
You will see outputs such as Mean Squared Error and R-squared values, along with graphical representations of the data.
